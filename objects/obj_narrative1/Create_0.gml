After landing, the astronaut gets out of the spaceship to speculate if there are\n any damages to their ship. During this, they are again taken aback by a huge sandstorm that throws them far\n away from their ship, damaging their oxygen tank. Their only mission now is to get back to their spaceship to\n refill the tank and get out of this planet.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            PRESS SPACE TO CONTINUE\n                                                      PRESS C TO SKIP THE BACKSTORY";
